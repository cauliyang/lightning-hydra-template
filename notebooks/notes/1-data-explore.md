# Data Exploration

## Plan

- SV data

  - [x] Find sv data of cell lines
  - [x] Check sv data

- Download data

  - [x] Download sv cell lines rna seq using `pybox`
  - [ ] Split fq files using `boss-fqsp`

- Explore Result of arriba

  - [ ] Explore arriba result

- Build Rule to find mapping relationship between sv and gene fusions

  - [ ] Implement rule to find mapping relationship using `cpp`
  - [ ] Check result

- Build Model to predict gene fusions for sv

  - [ ] Implement model
  - [ ] Define architecture
  - [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
  - [ ] Check result
  - [ ] Build pipeline

- Collect data

  - [ ] Collect data and plot e.g. confusion matrix, roc curve, precision recall curve
  - [ ] Model architecture figure
  - [ ] Rule algorithm figure
